                    <ol id="Ivan"><li>Libation Library or Family Food - Shared personally curated cookbook recipes that are manually input; why, I need it in my real life</li><li>Quotation Builder - Build a web app that generates estimates based on details input; why - real world business application</li><li>Customer 360 and Analytics; why - real world business application</li><li>Private Family / Group Photo Sharing Service - my wife and I really want something like this because we don’t trust Facebook and older family members don’t have an account. Would like to be able to upload and share a picture / short video (think 7 seconds max) each day. Then the next day the group gets a personalized Email with that special moment; why - I’d pay money for it.</li></ol>

                    <h2 class="text-center">Devin</h2>    
                    <ol id="Devin"><li>An app that allows users to log items they'd like to sell and get rid of. You'd be able to enter in items you're interested in selling, pull resources that would give the going rate for an item (avg ebay listing and sale prices, Amazon prices, any pricing data that can be retrieved) and then allows the user to easily list it on multiple platforms (eBay, Amazon, letgo). So, fill out one form, gather the info, and one click list an multiple platforms. Why - got the idea when I was trying to sell stuff to get money for an engagement ring, saw the work it took to do all of that, wished there was a better way.</li><li>Another transportation and mobility app. Don't have a super fleshed out idea but I just find transportation and mobility a cool field.</li><li>Something using Tensorflow.js. Again, not super fleshed out, lol, but I'm really interested in machine learning and the js API for Google's tensorflow seems like it could do some really cool things. This might be kinda lofty, but I'm just super interested in the technology and think using it would show initiative and be very interesting. This could even be incorporated into other project ideas (like maybe the second hand private sales app idea I had could use tensorflow to model best price).</li></ol>

                    <ol id="osman"><li>A social media like app that allows users to create a family tree profile and add branches e.g. grandpa>parents>user>user'skids>usergrandkids and restrict general public access to view unless granted access as a guest so parents like myself can upload photos,videos and family events and birthdays without compromising its security.</li><li>Personal finance app that allows a user to add personal assets,liabilities & equity and be able to visualize his/her net worth stack up against the rest of populations with his/her age group. User can add the type of rate on each liability and investment to see amortization schedule and the app will tell how long will it take for the user to get rid of debt if nothing additional is added. </li><li>App like Amazon Business Services that connects local professionals to customers who need services like: plumber, electricians, laptop repair, painter, etc. </li>
